* This project is a sub-project of XRCLOUD (https://xrcloud.app), an open-source project that aimed to provide membership-based cloud services for Hubs' Room and Scene resources, by forking the [hubs](https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation) project from [BELIVVR](https://belivvr.com) and developing additional features. 
  * (Korean) 본 프로젝트는 [BELIVVR](https://belivvr.com)에서 [hubs](https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation) 프로젝트를 fork하여 추가 기능을 개발하고, Hubs의 Room, Scene의 자원들을 회원제로 별도의 회원제 클라우드로 서비스를 제공하는 것을 목표 했던 XRCLOUD(https://xrcloud.app) 오픈소스 프로젝트의 서브 프로젝트 입니다.

* This repository is forked from [spoke created by hubfoundation](https://github.com/Hubs-Foundation/spoke).

## Features

:telescope: **Discover**: Explore images, videos, and 3D models from around the web, all without opening up a new tab. With media integrations from Sketchfab and Google Poly, you'll be on your way to creating a scene in no time.

:pencil2: **Create**: No external software or 3D modeling experience required - build 3D scenes using the Spoke web editor so you can have a space that's entirely custom to your needs. From a board room to outer space and beyond, your space is in your control.

:tada: **Share**: Invite people to meet in your new space by publishing your content to Hubs immediately. With just a few clicks, you'll have a world of your own to experience and share - all from your browser.
